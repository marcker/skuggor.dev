## About

> **Warning**: I'm currently available for freelance. Ask for a quotation.

My name is Marcos Garcia and I'm known on the web as *marcker*, started to like source code customizing the stylesheets folder of the old `Microsoft Windows 98` (without knowing anything about `CSS` yet) subsequently started learn `HTML 4.01` and do some small projects for local clients. At the same time, I taught computing for beginners in my town and, at lunchtime, studying `tableless`, `XHTML` and `CSS`.

Got over the years a certain level of quality when writing applications, charging myself a certain perfection. So, I had contact with many programming languages ​​(and still study): `Visual Basic`, `Python`, `PHP`, `JavaScript`, `CoffeeScript`, `ShellScript` among others.

Currently working with web applications and mainly use these resources: `JavaScript`, `HTML 5`, `CSS 3`, `SASS`, `CoffeeScript`, `GruntJS`, `WordPress` , `PHP`, `jQuery`, `JSON`, `Git`, `NodeJS` among other things.

Note: also has expertise in graphics software.
